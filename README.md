## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid

I started with creating an HTML outline of possible topics a typical company would cover and ranking them in order of importance. Then, I dissected each section and edited them on a separate file. This helped a lot when it came to styling because now I can see how the main CSS file is affecting each element and which element I can isolate and target.

## Optimizations

Adding little details like a hover or active style really makes the experience more enjoyable.

## Lessons Learned:

I probably spent more time researching ways to do this, but finding out how to link icons from https://fontawesome.com/ was rough. I spent a lot of time following guides and videos, but nothing was working and I didnâ€™t know why. I was really excited when I figured it out because having these small details adds a level of professionalism to a website.
